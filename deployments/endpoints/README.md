# endpoints

This directory contains support files that have been used to run the
`registry-server` in an otherwise-empty container (i.e. with no Envoy) with a
proxy provided by
[Google Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/).

WARNING: this has not been recently verified and will need updates to work with
recent versions of `registry-server`.
