# registry

This directory contains a handwritten command line interface for the Registry
API that provides higher-level features that are not in the
automatically-generated `apg` tool. Like `apg`, the `registry` tool uses the
[Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) interface generator, so help
information can be obtained by running `registry help` from the command line.
