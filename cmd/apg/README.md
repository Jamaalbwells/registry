# apg

This directory contains a command-line interface for the Registry API that is
automatically generated at build time.

Run `apg help` for general information and `apg registry help` for a list of
supported API operations. Every method of the Registry API is supported. The
Registry API server address and authentication tokens can be passed as
command-line options or specified with environment variables that are set by
the `AUTH-*.sh` scripts included with this project.
